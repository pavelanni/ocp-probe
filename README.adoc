== OCP Probe

This is a simple Python/Flask app to use in OpenShift training courses. 

The application has several version tags to create several container image
versions and demonstrate deployment strategies.

Tag `v0.2`: just outputs a simple HTML with the version and hostname

Tag `v0.3`: adds the `/version` REST API call which outputs the version.

Tag `v0.4`: adds the `/hostname` REST API call.
Can be used to demonstrate load balancing with Service.
Create a ReplicaSet with 3 (or more) instances and a Service in front of them.
Create a simple Pod in the same project and call `curl ClusterIP:8080/hostname` 
several times.
You will see that hostnames are different.

Tag `v0.5`: adds the `/healthz` REST API call.
Can be used to demonstrate readyness checks.
